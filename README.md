# HackTricks CSPM detections

This repository holds the reviewed Sigma rules used by Attack Analysis.
Rules live in `rules/*.yml`. The CSPM reads an exact commit SHA and rejects
unsupported grammar or malformed rules. A rule change takes effect only after
the reviewed SHA is updated in the CSPM release or its
`HACKTRICKS_CSPM_RULES_GITHUB_REF` override.

The CSPM reads this public repository without a token. The rule loader fails
closed if the pinned GitHub commit is unavailable and never falls back to an
older unreviewed rule set. Do not put credentials or customer audit data here.

The rules are deliberately narrow. A matched administrative action
requires investigation and does not by itself prove malicious intent.
The Azure Activity Log rule runs on a canonical event produced by joining
matching `Started` and `Succeeded` entries. The join is implemented in the
CSPM and is not a portable Sigma correlation rule; the Sigma selection
controls which successfully joined role grants become findings. The Entra
rule matches a successful service-principal credential-add activity in the
tenant's directory audit log and does not infer credential use.
